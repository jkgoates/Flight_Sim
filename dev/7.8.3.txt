Discussion
While both conditions are trim at the onset of the simulation, only case A remains trim. 
This is because as the airplane in case B climbs, the dynamic pressure drops. 
As this drops, so do the forces that were keeping the the aircraft in the steady coordinated turn.
Thus case B diverges from the steady coordinated turn of case A as seen in the plot.
